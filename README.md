#Write a beautiful code that passes the Betty checks	

##Write a UNIX command line interpreter.

#Usage: simple_shell
###Your Shell should:

- Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.
- The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
- The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.
- If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.
###Handle errors.
- You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D)
+ You don’t have to:
- use the PATH
- implement built-ins
- handle special characters : ", ', `, \, *, &, #
- be able to move the cursor
- handle commands with arguments
- execve will be the core part of your Shell, don’t forget to pass the environ to it…

#Simple shell 0.1 +
- Handle command lines with arguments

#Simple shell 0.2 +

- Handle the PATH
- fork must not be called if the command doesn’t exist

#Simple shell 0.3 +
- Implement the exit built-in, that exits the shell
- Usage: exit
- You don’t have to handle any argument to the built-in exit

#Simple shell 0.4 +
- Implement the env built-in, that prints the current environment

#Simple shell 0.1 +
- Write your own getline function
- Use a buffer to read many chars at once and call the least possible the read system call
- You will need to use static variables
- You are not allowed to use getline
- You don’t have to:

- be able to move the cursor

#Simple shell 0.2 +
- You are not allowed to use strtok

#Simple shell 0.4 +
- handle arguments for the built-in exit
- Usage: exit status, where status is an integer used to exit the shell

#Simple shell 1.0 +

##Implement the setenv and unsetenv builtin commands

+ setenv
- Initialize a new environment variable, or modify an existing one
- Command syntax: setenv VARIABLE VALUE
- Should print something on stderr on failure
+ unsetenv
- Remove an environment variable
- Command syntax: unsetenv VARIABLE
- Should print something on stderr on failure

#Simple shell 1.0 +

##Implement the builtin command cd:

- Changes the current directory of the process.
- Command syntax: cd [DIRECTORY]
- If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
- You have to handle the command cd -
- You have to update the environment variable PWD when you change directory

#Simple shell 1.0 +

- Handle the commands separator ;
